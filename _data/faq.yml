- title: What is this?
  body: <p>a collapsible div</p>

- title: Does it have any dependencies?  
  body: <p>Nope</p>

- title: Is it complicated?
  body: <p>Well, not really, but you do have to follow a few rules. It works best if you use jekyll and a data file to loop thru and build the proper strucure.</p>  

- title: Do I have to use it with Jekyll?
  body: <p>Nope, it just makes it easier to have the correct toggle/body index numbers.</p>

- title: You made it so it is perfect and works under all use cases right?
  body: <p>Well, no. It works great as a simple expandable FAQ, but I have not tried to use it for anything else. For example, if you stick a large image in one of the bodies it may not work properly.</p>
